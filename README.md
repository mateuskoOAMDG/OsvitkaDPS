# OsvitkaDPS
## Popis
OsvitkaDPS is a project for Arduino Nano that controls an illumination device for the production of printed circuit boards.

The program provides: 
* Control of 2 illumination lamps for illumination of double-sided PCBs (upper and lower lamp) 
* Option to choose which illumination lamp(s) will be switched on 
* Adjustable Timer with 1s accuracy
* 4 Timer setting presets - each preset has one button 
* Ability to set with a jumper whether the hardware supports one or two illumination lamps



The sketch and other necessary files are in the */src* folder. The sketch uses an external library that is located in the */library* folder. AFTER downloading, it must be unzipped and copied to the Arduino library folder (e.g. Arduino/library)
